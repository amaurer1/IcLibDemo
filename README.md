Interpolation is the determination of a mathematical function which passes through a set of given data points. This function can be used to calculate the intermediate values between the data points. Frequently used interpolation curve types like line segments or cubic splines are supplemented here by a new type: the finite splines. In the mathematical section, I will show an iterative algorithm which specifies the coefficients of the curves, as well as the formula for the calculation of the function value.
